Simple app to demonstrate Kaprekar's Constant

I'm sure this has been done before, but I just discovered this math concept so I wanted to attempt to create an app to demonstrate it to test myself just a bit.

The app will explain the theory briefly, then ask the user to enter a number based on the rules of the theory. It will then output each iteration of the process through completion for the user to see.
